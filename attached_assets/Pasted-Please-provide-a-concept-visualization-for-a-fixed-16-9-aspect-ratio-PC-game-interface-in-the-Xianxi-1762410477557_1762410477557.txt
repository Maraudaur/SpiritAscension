Please provide a concept visualization for a fixed 16:9 aspect ratio PC game interface in the Xianxia/Chinese Imperial Fantasy aesthetic (using parchment textures, vermillion, jade, and gold accents). The design must adhere to a Persistent Left Sidebar Navigation structure, ensuring a consistent user experience across multiple distinct game loops. The overall frame should feel contained and visually rich, similar to a high-quality Steam game application.

The Story Screen must serve as the primary hub (the default screen upon login) and operate on two layers. The default Story Map (Level 1) must occupy the main central canvas, displaying a large, visually appealing image of a map with clearly marked, sequential progression nodes. A prominent, center-aligned "Progress Story" button should transition the player to the next layer. This action should then open the Visual Novel Scene (Level 2) as a full-screen, high-immersion view with character portraits, background art, and a large, semi-transparent overlay textbox for dialogue. Crucially, the designer must incorporate placeholder elements to illustrate the underlying content architecture, such as a metadata/debug panel showing the current SceneID, Background Image URL, Dialogue Text Key, and Next Action (Encounter ID or Next Scene ID), demonstrating that the entire story flow is driven by an easily editable external data structure.

The Persistent Left Sidebar must feature five distinct, icon-driven buttons, with the Story button highlighted as the active Home state, followed by Cultivation (Incremental Loop), Spirit Manager, Summon (Gacha Portal), and Battle (Grind Missions). The Cultivation Screen should be designed as an efficient secondary screen, maintaining the recommended two-column layout (Ascension Progress on the left, Qi Upgrades/Buttons on the right). Finally, the Spirit Manager Screen visualization should adhere to the fixed Left Panel (Active 4-Spirit Party) and large Main Panel (Scrollable Spirit Inventory) structure, with detailed inspection opening in a Layer 2 modal overlay.
